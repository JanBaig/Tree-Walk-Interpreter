Parser:
Don't understand (2022-07-06):
    - (LATER) I don't really understand how the expression grammar works entirely
    - Don't understand how the ParseError works... Why does it extent the RuntimeException?
    - Synchronize the parser's own state? What does that mean?
        - Don't understand section 6.3.3 (Synchronizing a recursive decent parser)
